Measurements in Analytical Chemistry
####################################

Analytical chemistry is a quantitative science. Whether determining the concentration of a species, evaluating an equilibrium constant, measuring a reaction rate, or drawing a correlation between a compound’s structure and its reactivity, analytical chemists engage in “measuring important chemical things” [Murray, R. W. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 1765]. In this section we review briefly the basic units of measurement and the proper use of significant figures.

Units of Measurement
********************

A measurement usually consists of a unit and a number that expresses the quantity of that unit. We can express the same physical measurement with different units, which creates confusion if we are not careful to specify the unit. For example, the mass of a sample that weighs 1.5 g is equivalent to 0.0033 lb or to 0.053 oz. To ensure consistency, and to avoid problems, scientists use the common set of fundamental base units listed in Table 2.1.1 . These units are called SI units after the Système International d’Unités.

  "mass", "kilogram", "kg", "...the mass of the international prototype, a Pt-Ir object housed at the Bureau International de Poids and Measures at Sèvres, France."
  "distance", "meter", "m", "...the distance light travels in (299 792 458)–1 seconds."
  "temperature", "Kelvin", "K", "...equal to (273.16)–1, where 273.16 K is the triple point of water (where its solid, liquid, and gaseous forms are in equilibrium)."
  "time", "second", "s", "...the time it takes for 9 192 631 770 periods of radiation corresponding to a specific transition of the 133Cs atom."
  "current", "ampere", "A", "...the current producing a force of 2  ×  10–7 N/m between two straight parallel conductors of infinite length separated by one meter (in a vacuum)."
  "amount of substance", "mole", "mol", "...the amount of a substance containing as many particles as there are atoms in exactly 0.012 kilogram of 12C."
  "light", "candela", "cd", "...the luminous intensity of a source with a monochromatic frequency of :math:`540\times 10^{12}` hertz and a radiant power of :math:`683^{–1}` watts per steradian."
