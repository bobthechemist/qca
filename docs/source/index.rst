Quantitative Analysis in Chemistry
==================================

Quantitative Analysis in Chemistry (QAC) is an attempt to develop a one-semester introductory course to analytical chemistry for non-majors (e.g. students in biology, physics and environmental science) that leverages open-source materials to keep costs as reasonable as possible.  To do that, the course relies heavily on the `open source textbook by David Harvey <https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)>`_ with some modifications to streamline and focus the material for our intended audience.

Harvey's text is distributed under the `Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>`_ and therefore this material will adopt the same approach.  That means users are free to copy and redistribute this material in any medium or format as well as remix, transform and build upon the material (like we are doing).  Appropriate credit must be provided (thanks Dave!) and this material cannot be used for commercial purposes.

There is (or will be) a lab manual associated with this text.

Course structure
################

The course is broken into six *modules*.  The first three address general concepts such as how analytical chemists view scientific analysis and discovery and the tools used to make quantitative measurements.  Before exploring the three broad classes of scientific instrumentation, we look at chemical equilibria, since this phenomenon plays an important role in many aspects of chemical analysis.  In the remaining three instrumentation sections, we will cover the underlying theory of the approach as well as one or two examples of instrumentation.

1. :ref:`tools_intro` - A review of accuracy, precision, and tolerance, use of basic laboratory equipment such as balances and glassware, stoichiometry and solution preparation.
2. :ref:`stats_intro` - Overview of descriptive, comparative and modeling statistics.  Developing an appreciation for uncertainty in measurements, assessing whether or not two sets of measurements agree, and forming linear relationships between variables.
3. :ref:`equilibria_intro` - Using visual models (e.g. Ladder Diagrams) to obtain qualitative information about chemical equilibria, with an emphasis on weak acid/base chemistry, mathematical manipulations pertaining to weak acids and bases, buffer preparation, and ionic-strength calculations.
4. :ref:`spectroscopy_intro` - An introduction to Beer's Law and the design and use of a visible spectrophotometer.
5. :ref:`electrochemistry_intro` - Fundamentals of electrochemistry (e.g. heterogeneous nature of electrochemical methods, thermodynamic relationships described by the Nernst equation), potentiometric methods (e.g. pH and ion selective electrodes) and coulometric methods.
6. :ref:`chromatography_intro` - Separation theory with an emphasis on band broadening within a column (described by the van Deemter equation), an overview of HPLC and GC methods, including identifying a preferred method for a given analyte.

Since the aim is to cover each of the six modules more-or-less equally, each module is limited to approximately seven one-hour class periods.  It is not possible to do any of the instrumentation sections justice in that limited amount of time; however, it is our belief that exposure - even brief - to each of the topics is critical in order for the intended audience (non-majors) to start building an appreciation for what quantitative chemical analysis is, and what tools and approaches are available to them.
